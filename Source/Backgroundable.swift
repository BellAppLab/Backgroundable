//MARK: - Operations
/**
 An `AsyncOperation` is an easy way to perform asynchronous tasks in an `OperationQueue`. It's designed to make it easy to perform long-running tasks on an operation queue regardless of how many times its task needs to jump between threads. Only once everything is done, the `AsyncOperation` is removed from the queue. 
 
 ## Example
 
 ```
 operationQueue.addOperation(AsyncOperation({ (op) in
     //We're on a background thread now; NICE!
     self.loadThingsFromTheInternet(callback: { (result, error) in
         //process the result
         inTheBackground {
             //do more stuff in the background again
             //once everything is done, finish
             op.finish()
             //only now the queue will start working on the next thing
         }
     })
 }))
 ```
 
 Optionally, you can change the operation's default timeout time:
 
 ```
 AsyncOperation(timeout: 60) { (op) in
    //do something that will take less than a minute
 }
 ```
 
 - warning: Be sure to call `op.finish()` once your operation is done, otherwise it will time out. By default, AsyncOperations time out after 10 seconds. This is to avoid blocking any dependencies in the queue.
